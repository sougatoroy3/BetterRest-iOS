# 💤 BetterRest – Your Smart Sleep Companion

BetterRest is a beautifully designed iOS app built using **SwiftUI** and powered by **Core ML**. It helps users calculate their **ideal bedtime** based on their wake-up time, desired hours of sleep, and daily coffee intake. Whether you're optimizing your routine or just want to sleep smarter, BetterRest is here to help you wake up refreshed.

## 🚀 Features

- ⏰ **Dynamic Wake Time Picker**  
  Select when you'd like to wake up and let the app do the rest.

- ☕️ **Customizable Coffee Intake**  
  Adjust your daily coffee consumption — from 1 to 20 cups — and see how it impacts your sleep.

- 🛌 **Sleep Duration Control**  
  Choose how many hours of sleep you want (from 4 to 12 hours) in 15-minute increments.

- 🤖 **Machine Learning Powered**  
  Uses Apple’s Core ML and the **SleepCalculator.mlmodel** to make accurate sleep predictions.

- 📱 **Live Recommendations**  
  The ideal bedtime is always visible — updated in real-time as you adjust your preferences.

## 🧠 How It Works

Behind the scenes, BetterRest feeds your input into a CoreML model trained on sleep patterns. It considers:

- Your selected **wake-up time**
- The amount of **sleep** you desire
- Your **coffee intake** for the day

The result? A precise, personalized **recommended bedtime** that updates instantly.
